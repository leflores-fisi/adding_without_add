  Algorithm for adding without the sum operator.
  Content learned from Ben Eater <3, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJc9CZcvBc

  How we add binary numbers? Just like we add decimals.

     (1)(1)(0)
      1  1  1  0 +
      0  1  1  1
    ------------
   1  0  1  0  1

  This is how we are going to add here. :D
  But... without the sum operator? Yes.
  I highly recommend first watching the video above for a better concept.

  Did you remember logical operators?
  V and F === F
  F or  V === V
  V and V === V

  That is what bitwise operators are, but for bits:
  &   AND
  |   OR
  ^   XOR
  ~   NOT
  <<  LEFT SHIFT
  >>  RIGHT SHIFT

  Are the same? NO.
  Bitwise operators works with binary values.
  Logical operators works with boolean values.
  And are extremely related.

  That is,
  ~F === V
  ~11001 === 00110
  100 & 110 === ???

  See them like this, operating each column with the operator logical-definition:
  1 0 0  &
  1 1 0
  -----
  1 0 0

  Wow... this looks familiar.
  Yes :D, thats why we are going to use them for this algorithm.
  Also is the algorithm that your processor uses!!
  Now our problem is how we are going to handle the sum carries.
  And clearly the AND bitwise operator does not work as a binary sum.
  But XOR operator does. :D

  1 0 0  ^
  0 1 0
  -----
  1 1 0

  Wow! It add them perfectly. (4 + 2 = 6)
  But as mentioned before, is not enough yet.
  Here starts the code...

  It's awesome how we can define the math using the logic. <3

// Our final algorithm :D
unsigned long bitwiseSUM(int a, int b);


// All the following functions returns binary values (0 or 1).
// but are typed as int for convenience (type suggestions are welcome).


int BIT_SUM(int bit1, int bit2, int carry = 0);
int GET_SUM_CARRY(int bit1, int bit2, int prevCarry = 0);
// Bitwise operators (already defined by C++ but here for readability).
int AND    (int a, int b);
int OR     (int a, int b);
int XOR    (int a, int b);
// This function negates an integer (but is not used by the algorithm).

int main() {
    int first, second;

    do {
        std::cout << "Write a sum like \"a + b\"\n:";
        scanf("%d + %d", &first, &second);
        // it wooorks
        std::cout << "-> " << bitwiseSUM(first, second) << std::endl;

  This function add two bits and returns only one bit, its sum (the carry is later handled)
  All possible inputs and outputs:

    1 + 0 (carrying: 0) -> returns 1
    0 + 1 (carrying: 0) -> returns 1
    1 + 1 (carrying: 0) -> returns 0

    1 + 0 (carrying: 1) -> returns 0

    return XOR(logicSum, carry);
    // Now we need to handle the carry
}

/*
  Here we are going to determine the sum carry
  For that we need to considerate if a previous carry exist, because we are going to sum in chain.

// This function returns that carry (0 or 1)
int GET_SUM_CARRY(int bit1, int bit2, int prevCarry) {
    // First, we need to check if the bits sum will overflow
    // As mentioned before, only two ways exist:
    // - with carry and adding 0+0 or 1+1
    // - without carry and adding 1+1
    // People found smart ways to check this with bitwise operators :D

    int logicSum = XOR(bit1, bit2); // here XOR helps to check if bits are 1+0 or 0+1

    // First way
    // -> 1: only if (exist prevCarry) AND (bits are 1+0 or 0+1)
    int willOverflowWithCarry = AND(logicSum, prevCarry);
    // -> 1: only overflowed on 1+1 (thats why we use AND bitwise operator)
    int alreadyOverflowed = AND(bit1, bit2);

    // So.. we are going to have a carry if at least one of these conditions are "true"
    // Note that is impossible to have both as true
    int carry = OR(willOverflowWithCarry, alreadyOverflowed);
    return carry;
}

/*
  Now we can create our main algorithm, how exciting!
  The basic idea is transform our two integers to binary numbers,
  then iterate them adding each column with the BIT_SUM() function
  and saving each carry returned by GET_SUM_CARRY() for adding it to the next iteration.

  I made the code as self readable as possible, so enjoy <3
